# Development Plan for PFR Tool

# Concept

1.  PP receives notification that frequency event occurred.
2.  Data is manually extracted and saved to a location as a csv.
3.  Analysis Update script is run:

    3a. Event csv file is parsed and event data is stored in arrays.
    3b. Event analysis is performed using data arrays and results are
        stored in an event log file.  
        
        Analysis should include:
  
            - T0
            - Events online at the time of the event
            - Max/Min peak frequencies, Max/Min peak NAI
            - Average (T0-16 to T0-2) and (T0+20 to T0+52) frequencies
            - Average (T0-16 to T0-2) and (T0+20 to T0+52) NAI and unit MW 
            - Expectation (FRO) based on frequency delta (NERC metric) 
            - Combined fleet MW response (summed unit MW responses) based on 
              pre- and post-event averages. 
            - Breakdown of expected and actual responses for each unit online
              based on pre- and post-event averages
            - Unit proximity to capability and/or PFR MW/Limits

    3c. Analysis trends are built using data arrays and an image (.png) is stored.

        For each event, trend 

            - Figure 1 - Single Plot
              Frequency vs NAI vs Summed Gross MW vs FRO

            - Figures 2 - X - Double Plot
              Frequency vs Unit Gross MW vs PFR AC/EN signal
              Unit Gross MW vs PFR MW limits and/or Capability 

        Save each trend figure as a .png file for use in html reporting

    3d.  HTML reporting page is built for the event.

        Basic Format:

        Header1 (Primary Frequency Response Event Analysis)

        Header2 (Date and T0 of Event - Event Type [RCIS, NERC Quarterly, etc.]

        --- Horizontal Rule ---
        
        Navigation to PFR Reporting Interface Main Page

        --- Horizontal Rule ---

        List of units online at the time of event

        Table of overall event info (Good/Bad NAI Response, Good/Bad Fleet MW Response, 
            Peak Frequencies, FRO for NAI, FRO for units, NAI Response, Unit MW Response, 
            Unit Good/Bad Response breakdown)

        Analysis Figure 1

        --- Horizontal Rule ---
        Table 2 and Figure 2 to Table X and Figure X of unit event data 

    3e. Periodic metrics are updated 
    3f. PFR Reporting Interface is updated to include navigation to the new 
        event analysis page and any changes in periodic metrics.

# PRI Home Page

-   Should be basic, quick to read and navigate, and browser friendly
-   Should contain some metrics for YTD and QtrTD response success ratios
-   Should contain some navigation methodology for looking up past events
    by Yearly Listing, Quarterly Listing, Monthly Listing, 
    RCIS Listing, NERC Inquiry listing
